 ### Apk file for the app
 [Drive Me Apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14f08hBo8fjzt8J-Y8flTdr3s_x5Wmfb4/view?usp=sharing)

### Assumtions
1. Redirect URL is null in every response from services section so I added a static URL to open web view activity.
2. At second positon I added services section instead of social media since images from api contains relevent content.
